- 👋 Hi, I’m @UgurOeztuerk
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring spatial landslide patterns to better relate landslide incidents to their triggers, such as heavy rainfalls and earthquakes.
- 🌱 I’m learning about urban landslides and their role in urban development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data and code sharing.
